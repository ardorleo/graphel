This project aims at providing a generic graphical web-based user interface for drawing graphs.

The user-interface can be integrated and adapted to the needs of standards based modeling tools and languages, e.g. UML, BPMN based modeling tools, but may also be adapted to domain and project specific needs.

The project name "graphel" is an abbreviation for <u>Graph</u> <u>E</u>ditor <u>L</u>ight.

See an exemplary implementation screenshot of graphel for a process model editor below:
